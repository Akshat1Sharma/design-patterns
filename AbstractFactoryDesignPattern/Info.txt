Abstract Factory pattern suggests is to explicitly decalre interface
for each distinct product of the product family(e.g. chail,sofa or coffee table).

Then you can make all variants of products follow those interfaces. For example, all chair variants can implement the Chair interface; all coffee table variants can implement the CoffeeTable interface, and so on.
