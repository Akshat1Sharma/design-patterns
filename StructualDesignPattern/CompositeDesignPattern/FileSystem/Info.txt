Problem without Composite Design Pattern:
Imagine you are creating a system to manage 
different types of documents in a document 
hierarchy for a file storage system. 
There are two types of documents: Files and 
Folders. A File is a leaf node and cannot contain 
any other document. A Folder can contain multiple 
Files or other Folders, forming a tree structure. 
You need to implement a system to calculate the 
total size of all documents within a folder 
(including subfolders).
