Bridge is a structural design pattern that 
lets you split a large class or a set of closely 
related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction 
and implementation—which can be developed independently 
of each other.

Problem:
suppose you have a geometric shape class with a pair of subclasses:
    one is Circle and another is Square
you want to extend this class hierarchy to incoporatee colors, so you 
plan to create Red and Blue shape subclass.
so you will end up creating four subclass.

so the problem occur when we are trying to extend more features it will endup
creating hierarchy of classes.

The Bridge pattern attempts to solve this problem by switching 
from inheritance to the object composition.
