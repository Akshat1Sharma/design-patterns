Imagine you're building a system for handling 
different types of coffee orders. Each coffee 
type can have additional ingredients like milk, 
sugar, or whipped cream, and the cost increases 
with each added ingredient.

You could handle this by creating a class for 
each possible combination of coffee types and 
ingredients, but this would quickly lead to an 
explosion of classes.
