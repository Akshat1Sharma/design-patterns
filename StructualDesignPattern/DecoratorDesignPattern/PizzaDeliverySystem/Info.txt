Let's say you have different types of pizzas 
and you want to add various toppings, such as 
cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, etc. If you create 
a subclass for each combination of pizza and 
toppings, you will end up with a large number of 
subclasses like CheesePizza, CheeseAndPepperoniPizza,
CheeseAndMushroomPizza, etc. This approach 
becomes difficult to manage

Solution Using Decorator Pattern:

You can use the Decorator Design Pattern to wrap 
a basic pizza object with various toppings 
dynamically. This eliminates the need to create 
multiple subclasses for each combination of 
toppings.
