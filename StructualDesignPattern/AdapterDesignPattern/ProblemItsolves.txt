Imagine that you’re creating a stock market monitoring app. 
The app downloads the stock data from multiple sources in XML format 
and then displays nice-looking charts and diagrams for the user.

At some point, you decide to improve the app by integrating a smart 3rd-party analytics library.
But there’s a catch: the analytics library only works with data in JSON format.

You could change the library to work with XML. 
However, this might break some existing code that relies on the library. 
And worse, you might not have access to the library’s source code 
in the first place, making this approach impossible.
